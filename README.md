## Ingredients

|------|-----|----------------------|
|1/2   | cup | Shortening or Butter |
|1     | cup | Raisins              |
|1     | cup | Sugar                |
|1     | cup | Water                |
|2     | tsp | Cinnamon             |
|2     | tsp | Ground Cloves        |
|1     | tsp | Salt                 |
|1     | tsp | Baking Soda          |
|1 1/2 | Tbsp| Hot Water            |
|1 3/4 | cup | Flour                |

## Method

- Preheat your oven to 350 for steel baking dish or 325 for a glass baking dish.
- Mix shortening, raisins, sugar, water, cinnamon, and cloves in a small pot and
bring to a boil. Remove from heat the moment it comes to a boil and watch it carefully
because it will overflow easily.
- In a small bowl mix the salt, baking soda, and hot water. The hot water can come
from the tap as hot as it can get but it's best from the kettle.
- Once mixed well, add the small bowl to the pot
- Once those two batches are mixed together well, add the flour.
- Pour into a greased square baking dish. (8x8)
- Bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
